# AgentMesh Cortex - Changelog

## [2025-10-15] Major Updates - SlimeMold Optimization & Live Visualization

### üéØ Critical Bug Fixes

#### 1. **Fixed SlimeMold Edge Auto-Creation (CRITICAL)**
**Problem:** Edges were never created when messages flowed between agents. The system only called `ReinforceEdge()` which failed with "edge not found" errors.

**Impact:**
- SlimeMold optimization wasn't working correctly
- Messages were sent but topology wasn't being built
- False 95% reduction (edges never existed, not optimized away)

**Solution:** Modified `internal/topology/graph.go::ReinforceEdge()` to automatically create edges when messages flow:
- Creates edge with initial weight 0.5 on first message
- Then reinforces the edge (increases weight)
- Matches true SlimeMold behavior: paths form on first use

**Result:**
- Edges now auto-create when agents communicate
- True SlimeMold optimization: 50-95% reduction through intelligent pruning
- Frequently used paths get reinforced, unused paths decay and get pruned

#### 2. **Fixed Message Routing Diversity**
**Problem:** 3 out of 4 business agents always sent messages to Sales, creating unbalanced routing.

**Solution:** Added rotation logic in `cmd/agent/main.go`:
- Support: rotates between sales, inventory, fraud
- Inventory: alternates between sales, support
- Fraud: alternates between sales, support

**Result:** Balanced message distribution across all agents.

#### 3. **Fixed Kafka Consumer Offset Race Condition**
**Problem:** Agents published join events before topology-manager started consuming, causing missed events.

**Solution:** Changed `internal/messaging/kafka.go` from `LastOffset` to `FirstOffset`.

**Result:** Topology-manager now processes all agent join events reliably.

### ‚ú® New Features

#### 1. **Live Message Stream Visualization**
- Real-time WebSocket message stream in UI
- Shows agent-to-agent communication with:
  - Agent names (not UUIDs)
  - Message types (TASK, RESPONSE, VOTE, HEARTBEAT)
  - Color-coded message badges
  - Timestamps
  - Message payload details

**Files:**
- `web/static/js/messages.js` - Message stream component
- `web/server.go` - WebSocket broadcast logic
- `web/static/index.html` - UI layout with message panel

#### 2. **Unified Startup Script**
Created `scripts/start-all.sh` - bulletproof startup script with:
- Automatic Kafka topic creation
- Kafka readiness verification (30 retries)
- Agent retry logic (3 attempts per agent)
- Process health checks
- Browser auto-opening
- Comprehensive error messages

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/start-all.sh
```

#### 3. **Web UI Topology Data Source Fix**
**Problem:** Web UI fetched from its own local SlimeMold instance instead of authoritative Redis-backed topology.

**Solution:**
- Frontend now fetches from API server (http://localhost:8080/api/topology)
- WebSocket broadcasts also fetch from API server
- Removed redundant edge reinforcement in web-server

**Result:** All 7 agent nodes now visible in graph with correct edge data.

#### 4. **Accurate Statistics Calculation**
**Problem:** Density and Reduction percentages always showed 0%.

**Solution:** Added proper calculation in `web/server.go` and `web/static/js/app.js`:
- Density = totalEdges / maxPossibleEdges
- Reduction = ((maxPossibleEdges - totalEdges) / maxPossibleEdges) √ó 100

**Result:** Dynamic statistics showing real SlimeMold optimization metrics.
